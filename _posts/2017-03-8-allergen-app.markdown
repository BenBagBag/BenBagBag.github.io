I built this Allergen List Lookup App (ALLA) in React for the UW JS200 course.

It helps you navigate food allergies by letting you add a list of your allergies and then searching for a recipe. You get back two lists of recipes matching your search query: one with allergens and one without. You can then make an informed decision about what questions to ask about a dish at restaurants or your well-meaning-but-clueless-friend's house, and you can find recipes that cater to your needs.

I accept no liability for what happens if you rely entirely on this app instead of your own common sense/caution.

You can play with it [here](https://benbagbag.bitbucket.io/allergen_app/).
