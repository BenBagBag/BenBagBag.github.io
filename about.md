<p>I'm currently a junior front-end developer and knowledge curator at the <a href="http://allenai.org/" target="_blank">Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>. I started working on our website in 2015--building out new infrastructure, improving our existing infrastructure, and helping researchers highlight their work on our site. Side projects have included building a demo and an interactive quiz in React for two of our projects.</p>

<p>I also work on data curation and annotation. I've put together iPython notebooks to streamline interaction with Amazon's Mechanical Turk to make crowdsourcing easier, designed a pipeline to process over 7,000 science questions that combined automated and human review, and have tracked down almost any type of data you can think of.</p>

<p>In a past life, I went to grad school to study early Jewish legal texts and worked at the Yale University Library, where I cataloged hundreds of rare Hebrew books that had never been fully cataloged before. Now in my spare time I teach <a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/talmud-101/" target="_blank">Talmud</a>, in the original Aramaic and Hebrew, to adults who haven't studied Talmud previously. This is basically like handing someone a copy of the original Magna Carta and a Latin-English dictionary and showing them how to walk through both the grammar and the legal logic at the same time. It's a blast.</p>

<p>My Github handle is pronounced "ben bah-g bah-g" and is a reference to the 1st century C.E. sage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bag-Bag" target="_blank">Ben Bag Bag</a>, who said, "Turn it over and over, for everything is within it." This is either a terribly clever metaphor for finding bugs in one's own code or a recipe for disaster in a world where everything has a million dependencies. Your call.</p>
